## Flask Event

## Project Summary

This repository implements a Dockerized Flask-based API service focused on event-related functionality ("Flask Event"). It is designed for local development and production-ready deployment using Docker Compose and includes database migration support.

Key points
- Core technology: Flask web application exposing a RESTful API.
- Containerization: Docker images and a Docker Compose configuration orchestrate at least an `api` service (the Flask app) and a database service.
- Database migrations: Uses Flask-Migrate / Alembic; migration lifecycle is managed with `flask db init`, `flask db migrate`, and `flask db upgrade` executed inside the `api` container.
- Development workflow: Build and run with `docker compose up --build -d`, run migrations via `docker compose exec api`, and view logs or run the app in foreground with `docker compose up`.
- Access: API is exposed on localhost at the Compose-configured port (`http://localhost:<port>`).

Repository layout (typical)
- api/ — Flask application package (routes, models, configuration)
- migrations/ — Autogenerated migration scripts and Alembic metadata
- Dockerfile(s) — Build instructions for the API image
- docker-compose.yml — Service definitions and networking
- README.md — Project overview and usage instructions

How to contribute or extend
- Add or modify Flask routes and models in the api package.
- Create new migration scripts with `flask db migrate` after model changes, then apply with `flask db upgrade`.
- Update Dockerfile or Compose service definitions to change runtime settings, add services, or expose additional ports.

Overall, the codebase provides a portable Flask API scaffold with Docker-based development and database migration patterns for rapid iteration and deployment.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
* Git for version control

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

2. Build and start the containers:
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

3. Initialize the database:
```bash
docker compose exec api flask db init
docker compose exec api flask db migrate
docker compose exec api flask db upgrade
```

### Running the Application
* Start the application:
```bash
docker compose up
```
* Access the API at `http://localhost:<port>`

### Stopping the Application
```bash
docker compose down
```
